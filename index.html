        <p>Hello, my name is Sesugh Robert Mbatiav. I am from Benue State Nigeria, based in Abuja Nigeria. I love WDD 130. Web developers 
            are the technological wizards behind the websites and web applications you use every day. They take ideas and designs and turn 
            them into functional, interactive realities on the web. In tis course WDD 130, I am learning to become a Frontend and a Backend 
            web developer. I am learning to write code to build the structure and functionality of websites. This involves using a variety of 
            programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Front-end developers focus on the visual aspects and user experience of a 
            website, while back-end developers handle the server-side functionality and database management. Full-stack developers are a 
            jack-of-all-trades, capable of handling both front-end and back-end tasks. Web development involves a lot of problem-solving and 
            troubleshooting. Developers often collaborate with designers, project managers, and other specialists to bring a website or 
            application to life.</p>

        <h2>Abuja Nigeria</h2>

        <p>Abuja is the capital and eighth most populous city of Nigeria. Situated in the middle of the country within the Federal 
            Capital Territory (FCT), it is a planned city built mainly in the 1980s based on a master plan by International Planning 
            Associates (IPA), a consortium of three American planning and architecture firms made up of Wallace, Roberts, McHarg & 
            Todd as the lead, Archi systems International, and Planning Research Corporation. The Central Business District of Abuja 
            was designed by Japanese architect Kenzo Tange. It replaced Lagos, the country's most populous city, as the capital on 
            12 December 1991.</p>
