        <p>Abuja is the capital and eighth most populous city of Nigeria. Situated in the middle of the country within the Federal 
            Capital Territory (FCT), it is a planned city built mainly in the 1980s based on a master plan by International Planning 
            Associates (IPA), a consortium of three American planning and architecture firms made up of Wallace, Roberts, McHarg & 
            Todd as the lead, Archi systems International, and Planning Research Corporation. The Central Business District of Abuja 
            was designed by Japanese architect Kenzo Tange. It replaced Lagos, the country's most populous city, as the capital on 
            12 December 1991.</p>
